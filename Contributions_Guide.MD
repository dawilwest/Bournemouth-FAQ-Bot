## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
   ```
3. **Set Up the Remote**: Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork updated:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
   ```
4. **Sync Your Fork**: Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

## Workflow Overview

We follow the **Git Feature Branch Workflow** to ensure a streamlined and organized collaboration process.

1. **Main Branch** (`main`): This branch contains the stable, production-ready code.
2. **Development Branch** (`dev`): This branch serves as the integration branch where features are developed and tested before being merged into the `main` branch.
3. **Feature Branches**: New features, bug fixes, or experiments should be developed on separate branches based on the naming convention below.

## Branch Naming Convention

To maintain clarity and organization, follow this naming convention for branches:

### Format
```
git branch <category/reference/description-in-kebab-case>
```

### Categories
- **feature**: For adding, refactoring, or removing a feature.
- **bugfix**: For fixing a bug.
- **hotfix**: For urgent changes or temporary solutions.
- **test**: For experimenting outside of an issue or ticket.

### Examples
- Adding a new feature: `feature/issue-42/create-new-button-component`
- Fixing a bug: `bugfix/issue-342/button-overlap-form-on-mobile`
- Emergency fix: `hotfix/no-ref/registration-form-not-working`
- Experimenting: `test/no-ref/refactor-components-with-atomic-design`

---

## Commit Naming Convention

Commit messages should be concise and follow this format:

### Format
```
git commit -m '<category: do something; do some other things>'
```

### Categories
- **feat**: Adding a new feature.
- **fix**: Fixing a bug.
- **refactor**: Improving code for performance or readability.
- **chore**: Miscellaneous tasks like writing documentation, formatting, or adding tests.

### Examples
- Adding a feature: `git commit -m 'feat: add new button component; add button to templates'`
- Fixing a bug: `git commit -m 'fix: add stop directive to button to prevent propagation'`
- Refactoring code: `git commit -m 'refactor: rewrite button component in TypeScript'`
- Documentation: `git commit -m 'chore: write button documentation'`

2. **Describe Your Changes**:
   - Provide a clear title and description of the changes made.
   - Reference the issue or ticket number (if applicable).
3. **Request Reviews**:
   - Add reviewers who can provide feedback and approve your PR.
4. **Address Feedback**:
